React Native Mobile Chat App

### Objective

To build a chat app for mobile devices using React Native. The app will
provide users with a chat interface and options to share images and their
location.

### Tools

- Javascript
- React Native
- Expo
- Navigator

### Context

More and more people use their phones for daily tasks, such as shopping, creating to-do lists,
communicating with friends, scheduling meetings, and more. That's why many companies offer native
mobile versions of their web apps, or even skip creating a web app entirely.
In the past, building high-quality mobile apps required a lot of time and money because writing apps
for different platforms like iOS and Android required specialized programmers who could build and
maintain multiple codebases.
Over time, however, new technologies emerged that made it easier for companies to build and
maintain mobile applications using familiar syntax. One of these technologies is React Native, a
framework for building Android and iOS apps that only requires one codebase.
For this Achievement’s project, you’ll use React Native, Expo, and Google Firestore Database to build a
chat app that you can add to your portfolio and demonstrate your knowledge of JavaScript mobile
development.
